# Advanced Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

Building on the foundational knowledge from the previous unit, this unit covers more advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism. These concepts will be crucial as students move toward building more complex applications.

## Project: Shape Drawing Application

### Description
Develop a shape drawing application where students implement different shapes (e.g., Rectangle, Circle, Triangle) that inherit from a base Shape class. Each shape will override a method like calculateArea() or draw(). The project emphasizes inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism.

### Concepts
Inheritance, method overriding, polymorphism
